# RemoveConexantKeylogger
Quick and dirty powershell script to stop and remove conexant keylogger


I first came across this on Reddit src(https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/6ajfpc/keylogger_in_hp_conexant_hd_audio_audio_driver/).

Run the script as admin. Tested as working on my system running Windows 10 Education x64 build 1703
